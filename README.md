# Embedded message
The embedded message is:

Garfield, oh Garfield,<br>
Feline of orange and black,<br>
Lazy and loveable,<br>
You're the king of the pack.<br>
<br>
Your love for lasagna,<br>
Is truly quite grand,<br>
And with a cute little smirk,<br>
You steal hearts across the land.<br>
<br>
Your mornings are slow,<br>
Your afternoons naps,<br>
But when it's time for mischief,
You'll run circles and tap dance.

You're quite the character,
Full of wit and charm,
And even though you're a cat,
You've got human-like charm.

Garfield, oh Garfield,
You're a beloved cat,
And as long as there's lasagna,
We'll always have that.
